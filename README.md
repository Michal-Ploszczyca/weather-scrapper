# Weather Data Extractor for Twitter Bot ☀️

This script is a crucial component of the broader Twitter Weather Bot project. It's primarily tasked with fetching real-time weather details from `pogoda.interia.pl` and preparing this data for tweeting.

## 🚀 Features

   - The script fetches data from `pogoda.interia.pl`, which provides comprehensive weather updates.
   
2. **Weather Data Extraction**:
   - With the assistance of BeautifulSoup, this script efficiently scrapes weather details, including temperatures of various cities.
   
3. **Data Processing**:
   - The parsed data is processed and structured, ready to be incorporated into the main Twitter bot script for tweeting.

## 💼 Tech Stack

- **BeautifulSoup**: Utilized for parsing the HTML content and extracting the desired weather data.

## 📝 Instructions

- Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed: `beautifulsoup4` and `requests`.
